# bigquery-binder-example

Project trying to provide a simple implementation of BigQueryBinder for Spring Cloud Stream.
Currently not working.

Application can be started by running

* `mvn spring-boot:run -Pautocompose -Dkafka.mode=rabbit-to-kafka` to test connection between rabbitmq and kafka
* `mvn spring-boot:run -Pautocompose -Dkafka.mode=rabbit-to-bigquery` to test connection between rabbitmq and bigquery

Servers are available the following way

* [rabbitmq](https://localhost:56672) as guest:guest
* [kafka-hq](https://localhost:48080) (with no login)
